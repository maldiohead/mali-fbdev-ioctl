A collection of tools to analyze the fbdev ioctl behaviour of the Mali (r4p0) userspace blob.

test: initialize EGL and do some test rendering
dump: acts as a preloader and dumps ioctl calls made by the Mali blob
hook: preloader that overrides ioctls calls made by the blob

The idea is to extend 'hook' such that it translates all calls to the fbdev layer (which are emulated) to calls to the DRM layer.
